Previous submissions to CDP only included scope 1 and 2 emissions which drew directly from the national government DECC Local and Regional CO2 Emissions Estimates for 2005-2012 which used similar but not identical methodologies. This is part of a longer trend of decreasing emissions, punctuated with occasional increase years. Primary factors which determine the performance are the use of coal in any one year for grid electricity generation, and weather conditions during spring and autumn, where an extended heating season can occur if these are cold. A decline in total energy consumption is the most significant long term trend factor, due to the uptake of more energy efficient appliances, home adaptations, goods, services and transport",

  "ReasonForChange": "In 2010, community-wide emissions with large industrial emitters had increased from 2005 by 24% while community-wide emissions without large industrial emitters increased by 41%.  There was a 5.6% increase in emissions (2000-2005, with large emitters).   When the baseline inventory was completed, the team predicted that by 2010, emissions (w/ large industrial emitters) would increase 9% from 2005 to 4.6 million metric tons.  If large emitters were still included, then the increase between 2005 and 2010 was only a 24% increase, 15% more than what was originally predicted.  However, for 2010, it was decided to exclude large emitters.  This means that increases in all other sectors have a greater impact on total emissions, i.e. the increase in transportation emissions has a much greater impact on overall emissions levels.   The roughly 35% increase between 2005 and 2010 could be due to a number of things including changes in reporting protocols, e.g. permitting requirements changed or the non-recession years outweighed the recession years.  It could also be that Benicia was not as hard hit by the recession as other communities and therefore, emissions didn't decrease. Again, educated guesses have been made as to what caused the increase.    Please note that vehicle miles travelled (VMT) grew between 2000 and 2010 by 62%, while emissions increased 95%.  The % of total emissions from transportation is within the Bay Area average. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) calculates VMT using a proprietary software model. MTC inputs traffic counts, vehicle speeds, vehicle make and model, and fuel data into its software. In 2010, per the change in the modeling software, Benicia is now responsible for 50% of the trips that start elsewhere but end in Benicia and trips that start in Benicia but end elsewhere. This is calculated based on the number of people that exit or enter the highway in Benicia. Pass through VMT is not attributed to Benicia. Then, emissions are calculated by inputting VMT into the CACP software, which generates a GHG equivalent (MTCO2e). The increase in off road emissions is due to construction permit projections for buildings, which may have never been built. However, estimating off road emissions using construction permit data is the recommended calculation method per ICLEIâ€™s protocol and guidance.",

Recalculating 2003 and 2008 inventories to compare to the 2013 inventory shows that emissions have decreased by about 4% since the 2008 inventory, but have still increased by 10% since 2003. Several exogenous factors reduced emissions - such as lower electricity emission factors due to a cleaner electric grid, and better fuel efficiency and lower tailpipe emission factors for cleaner vehicles. However, Pittsburgh did see reductions in the tonnage of solid waste sent to landfill and a reduction in vehicle miles traveled. The industrial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2003, and less natural gas in 2013 than in 2008. The commercial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2008, but used significantly more natural gas. The residential sector increased electricity use and substantially increased natural gas use. The increase in natural gas is likely due to improved data quality, but seems to also correlate to the rise of hydraulic fracturing in the region. Natural gas emissions increased almost three-fold since 2003.",

Community emissions per capita have also steadily dropped over time from 17.51 to 12.24 metric tons CO2e/person, a 30 % reduction, from 2002 to 2015.

It is important to note, that electricity related emissions from municipal operations dropped 11% from 2011 to 2015. In addition DME expanded itâ€™s free residential and small commercial energy audit program in 2008, and launched the GreenSense Energy Efficiency Rebate program for residential and small commercial customers in 2009.  The City created a Conservation Program Coordinator position in 2014 to enhance the audit and rebate program, and to develop increased public education about energy and water conservation.

Total emissions in this sector increased between 1990 and 2008, however, they have been decreasing since 2008.

This occurred despite an emissions increase in the Railways sub-sector emissions which was affected by a methodology change in the way Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) began collecting more specific power data and their use of a more conservative or higher emissions factor starting CY2013.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nRegarding the Waste sector, first, wastewater fugitive data collection was improved with better activity data.  This resulted in a more accurate picture of the contribution of fugitive wastewater emissions\t thus, cutting by nearly half what was originally reporting in 2012. Consequently, when we compare the Waste sector since last inventoried,  emissions actually increased 18% influenced by not only an increase in total wastewater treatment and discharge emissions, but also because of an 18% increase in solid waste disposed emissions.  The updated CY2013 waste characterization study was more detailed which allowed a closer look at organic waste.  As a result, the category \"Other Organic Waste\" is now included as organic\t previously categorized as inorganic.  Recategorization alone resulted in a 9% emissions increase.   The remaining 9% was a result of an increase in Wood+Textiles as well as Paper landfilled and thus emissions at ~5% and 4%, respectively.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Agriculture sector emissions increased nearly three-fold because the data source seems to have reported significant increases in CH4 animal waste while not allocating any biogenic emissions\t nonetheless, agriculture still remains a fraction of this urban city's overall activity.",

There was a 2.3% decrease in stationary energy (SE) use Scope 1 emissions, which may be due to a warmer than average winter, and 2.2% decrease in SE Scope 2 emissions relating to electricity, which may be due to more efficient use of electricity and more renewable energy on the Provincial grid.  The sector which saw the greatest decrease (-4.9%) in emissions was from Transportation.  This is likely a result of the economic downturn that Calgary has experienced since 2014.

  "ChangeFromLastYear": "Increased",
  "ReasonForChange": "In 2010, community-wide emissions with large industrial emitters had increased from 2005 by 24% while community-wide emissions without large industrial emitters increased by 41%.  There was a 5.6% increase in emissions (2000-2005, with large emitters).   When the baseline inventory was completed, the team predicted that by 2010, emissions (w/ large industrial emitters) would increase 9% from 2005 to 4.6 million metric tons.  If large emitters were still included, then the increase between 2005 and 2010 was only a 24% increase, 15% more than what was originally predicted.  However, for 2010, it was decided to exclude large emitters.  This means that increases in all other sectors have a greater impact on total emissions, i.e. the increase in transportation emissions has a much greater impact on overall emissions levels.   The roughly 35% increase between 2005 and 2010 could be due to a number of things including changes in reporting protocols, e.g. permitting requirements changed or the non-recession years outweighed the recession years.  It could also be that Benicia was not as hard hit by the recession as other communities and therefore, emissions didn't decrease. Again, educated guesses have been made as to what caused the increase.    Please note that vehicle miles travelled (VMT) grew between 2000 and 2010 by 62%, while emissions increased 95%.  The % of total emissions from transportation is within the Bay Area average. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) calculates VMT using a proprietary software model. MTC inputs traffic counts, vehicle speeds, vehicle make and model, and fuel data into its software. In 2010, per the change in the modeling software, Benicia is now responsible for 50% of the trips that start elsewhere but end in Benicia and trips that start in Benicia but end elsewhere. This is calculated based on the number of people that exit or enter the highway in Benicia. Pass through VMT is not attributed to Benicia. Then, emissions are calculated by inputting VMT into the CACP software, which generates a GHG equivalent (MTCO2e). The increase in off road emissions is due to construction permit projections for buildings, which may have never been built. However, estimating off road emissions using construction permit data is the recommended calculation method per ICLEIâ€™s protocol and guidance.",

Several exogenous factors reduced emissions - such as lower electricity emission factors due to a cleaner electric grid, and better fuel efficiency and lower tailpipe emission factors for cleaner vehicles. However, Pittsburgh did see reductions in the tonnage of solid waste sent to landfill and a reduction in vehicle miles traveled. The industrial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2003, and less natural gas in 2013 than in 2008. The commercial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2008, but used significantly more natural gas. The residential sector increased electricity use and substantially increased natural gas use. The increase in natural gas is likely due to improved data quality, but seems to also correlate to the rise of hydraulic fracturing in the region.

Repeating the reasons for the change - between emissions reported in 2015 submission and now (due to move to a compliant BEI process), this is due to inclusion of scope 3 emissions included in the Basic/Basic+ element of the inventory which GM commissioned which is now compliant with the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC), (WRI, C40 and ICLEI).  Previous submissions to CDP only included scope 1 and 2 emissions which drew directly from the national government DECC Local and Regional CO2 Emissions Estimates for 2005-2012 which used similar but not identical methodologies. This is part of a longer trend of decreasing emissions, punctuated with occasional increase years. Primary factors which determine the performance are the use of coal in any one year for grid electricity generation, and weather conditions during spring and autumn, where an extended heating season can occur if these are cold. A decline in total energy consumption is the most significant long term trend factor, due to the uptake of more energy efficient appliances, home adaptations, goods, services and transport",

  "TotalEmissions": 263352,
  "ChangeFromLastYear": "Decreased",
  "ReasonForChange": "In comparison to the 2013 inventory , the emissions from Gibraltar are largely unchanged for scope 1. As in 2013, the scope 1 emissions are dominated by transport emissions, which have remained fairly constant across the period, demonstrating a 5kt increase. This change is largely due to increases in estimates in private marine fuel consumption after the use of more detailed, disaggregated fuel import data, as described in Section 4.2.1 of the inventory report. IPPU emissions remain a significant source of scope 1 emissions, and have also increased by 1kt in comparison to 2013. Emissions in this sector are estimated using population as a proxy, and therefore population growth within Gibraltar will have somewhat influenced the calculated increase in scope 1 emissions. Improved data has also been used to calculate IPPU emissions in Gibraltar\t for example, activity data regarding MDIs and N2O use has been provided by the Gibraltar Health Authority, rather than relying on scaling UK data. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhen scope 2 emissions are considered, there is a 30kt decline in total emissions. A reduction in consumed gas oil used for electricity generation and an apparent improvement of the implied emission factor cause a decline in emissions from residential, and commercial, industrial, and government buildings and facilities. This is largely responsible for this trend.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWaterborne navigation emissions have declined due to a methodology change within the calculation of emissions from shipping. As outlined in Section 4.2.3 of the inventory report, the definition of shipping attributable to Gibraltar on the basis of the recorded â€˜purpose of callâ€™ has undergone significant changes, and as a result, the emissions from scope 3 are largely reduced in 2015. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBecause of a large number of method changes, an updated reporting approach using the now-finalised GPC, and data for the 2015 inventory method not being available for updating the 2013 inventory, it is not possible to confidently identify how much change in emissions is due to changing method versus changing activity.

  "ReasonForChange": "Chicago conducted a preliminary comparison using the existing 2010 and 2015 data to evaluate how community emissions have changed over the last five years. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nResults of this preliminary analysis of 2010 and 2015 GHG emissions reveals Chicago continued to reduce total GHG emissions through 2015 in the stationary and waste sectors resulting in a greater than 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions over the last five years. During that time, Chicagoâ€™s population grew by approximately 1 percent while the regionâ€™s GRP grew by more than 12 percent. Growth coupled with reduction in total emissions resulted in a greater than 8 percent decrease in per capita emissions in the City.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBetween 2010 and 2015, the majority of MT CO2e reductions occurred in the stationary energy sector, followed by waste. When considering percent reductions, the waste sector experienced the greatest reduction (30 percent) which included a 35 percent emissions reduction in the solid waste disposal sub-sector. This reduction in the solid waste sector is likely driven by a decrease in the total amount of solid waste sent to landfills and an improvement in the solid waste treatment technologies at those landfills. The City expanded its residential curbside recycling pilot program to now serve over 400,000, or approximately 33 percent, of additional City houeholds.Because of the programâ€™s expansion the City experienced a significant increase in the number of tons collected for recycling, from 58,000 in 2010 to 97,000 in 2015.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe stationary energy sector overall saw a 10 percent drop in emissions, including 11, 12 and 8 percent emissions reductions in the residential, commercial and institutional buildings and facilities, and manufacturing industries and construction sub-sectors, respectively. Stationary energy sector GHG emissions reductions are likely driven by a general trend in the building industry to improve energy efficiency of buildings as well as a regional shift in energy generation towards renewable energy sources. The City has also implemented the Energy Benchmarking Ordinance, Retrofit Chicago, and the Chicago Solar Express to encourage increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy generation and consumption within the city.",
